# vircampype

Welcome to the <em>vircampype repository</em>! This repository holds the source code for the data processing environment for all data obtained within the context of the ESO [VISIONS public survey](http://visions.univie.ac.at). You can find an overview of the project in the survey's main paper ([Meingast et al. 2023a](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08831)). The algorithms used in the pipeline are described in a separate publication ([Meingast et al. 2023b](https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.08840)).

## Issues

Please note that this project is still in development and the documentation is not yet available. However, we are working on creating simple online documentation, including an example of how to run the pipeline. In addition, we will make a Docker image available for easy deployment.

If you encounter any issues while using this project, please feel free to submit an issue on this repository. We will do our best to respond as soon as possible.

Thank you for your patience as we work to create a better user experience for this project.
